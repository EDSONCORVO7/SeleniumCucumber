@Amazon @Cart
Scenario: As a Customer when I search for Alexa, I want to see if the third option on the second page is available for purchase and can be added to the cart. # src/test/resources/features/AmazonSearch.feature:5
  Given the user navigates to www.amazon.com                                                                                                                  # steps.AmazonSearchSteps.navigateToAmazon()
  And searches for Playstation                                                                                                                                # steps.AmazonSearchSteps.enterSearchCriteria(java.lang.String)
  And navigates to the second page                                                                                                                            # steps.AmazonSearchSteps.navigateToSecondPage()
  And selects the third item                                                                                                                                  # steps.AmazonSearchSteps.selectsThirdItem()
  Then the user is able to add it to the cart                                                                                                                 # steps.AmazonSearchSteps.itemCanBeAddedToTheCart()
